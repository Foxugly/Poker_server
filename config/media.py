"""Absolute media URLs for API responses.

The frontend is served from a different host than the media (poker.foxugly.com
vs poker-api.foxugly.com), so a bare ``/media/...`` path would 404 there. Every
serializer that returns an image URL must make it absolute — the room snapshot
already does this; this is the shared helper for the rest.
